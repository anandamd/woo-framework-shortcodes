# woo-framework-shortcodes
WooThemes uses WooFramework which comes with loads of shortcodes, if you have used the theme for a long time you may have used the 
shortcodes in your pages. Switching over to another theme becomes difficult as the shortcodes aren't supported in a non WooTheme. 
With the help of this plugin easily switch to a non WooThemes theme but retain the framework shortcodes.

## Disclaimer
Please note this is not an official WooThemes plugin. I have created this plugin
with the hope that it will help someone switch to another theme like Storefront that doesn't
have shortcodes that are provided by a WooThemes theme. All the copyrights and
